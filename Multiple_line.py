# Delera, Aritz B.

# Write a method in python to write multiple line of text contents into a text file mylife.txt. See sample output:
# Enter line: Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Are there more lines y/n? y
# Enter line: Explicit is better than implicit.
# Are there more lines y/n? y
# Enter line: Simple is better than complex.
# Are there more lines y/n? n 

# Make a function def method
# Make a file called "mylife.txt" and give it permission to be written to with the "write" command. 
# Loop over the code using a while statement.
# The "write" method of the file object will be used to save the line of text to the file, followed by a newline character (\n).
# Ask if the user wants to add more lines by asking y/n.
# If n, then break the code.
# call the method to run the code
